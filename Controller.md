# Introduction #

Controllers are used to control [mechanisms](Mechanism.md). They contain all of the logic necessary to tell a [Mechanism](Mechanism.md) what to do. For example, a kicker [Mechanism](Mechanism.md) might have to turn a motor until a limit switch is hit. The Controller of that [Mechanism](Mechanism.md) would contain the necessary if-then statement.
