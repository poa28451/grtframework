# Prefix Use #

Throughout the GRTFramework, non-abstract/generic files and objects are prefixed by "GRT". This is to prevent type confusion, as well as to distinguish framework code from WPILib code or Logic.
If you add to the Framework, we ask that you include this prefix, regardless of the packaging structure you use.

Note that writing Mechanisms or Controllers does not entail "adding to the framework".

Thanks.
